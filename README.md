## What is the purpose of this script?

This is intended to be a fix for the steam version of Final Fantasy 8 (original not remastered).
This script will change the proton version for the game but this can be selected also some user input is needed

make sure a version below 5.13 is running for proton as any version after will throw an error with protontricks since cabextract doesn't support symbolic links in 5.13 or newer this can be done by right clicking ff8 in your library and selecting "properties" then select the "compatibility" tab and turn on "force the use of a specific steam play compatibility tool" then select an appropriate version
